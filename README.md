# Microsoft-Updates
If you just got a fresh Windows 10 and you don't know why your Internet stopped working around the same time, try this. These are scripts to enable and disable Microsoft Updates, for people with slower connections or that otherwise want to manually control updates.

*Make sure to run with administrative privileges!

Right-click the below links and save them to your computer, then right-click the script you want to run and click "Run as Administrator." The MSFT_Off will disable updates and MSFT_On will reenable them.
